# C++ File I/O – Sum & Average Calculator 📂➕📊

This is a simple C++ program that reads a list of numbers from a file called `input.txt`, calculates their sum and average, and writes the results into another file called `output.txt`.

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. The program opens `input.txt` to read integer numbers.
2. It adds all the numbers together and counts how many numbers there are.
3. If at least one number is found, it calculates the average.
4. Finally, it writes both the sum and the average to `output.txt`.
